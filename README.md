# Vibe Match üíñ

---

## üöÄ Project Overview

**Vibe Match** is a lightweight, interactive web application that simulates a modern dating/matching platform. Built purely with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, it demonstrates fundamental front-end development skills including dynamic DOM manipulation, asynchronous data fetching, and engaging UI/UX design. Users can "Like" or "Nope" profiles, mimicking the popular swipe-based interaction, with profiles fetched from the [Random User API](https://randomuser.me/).

This project highlights my ability to create responsive, user-friendly interfaces and manage application state in vanilla JavaScript, making it a strong showcase for front-end development roles.
